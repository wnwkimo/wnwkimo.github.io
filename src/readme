# WoW PvP Leaderboard Scraper

A Python tool to fetch World of Warcraft PvP leaderboard data from Battle.net API, supporting both legacy and current season formats.

## Features

- Supports Season 1-11+ leaderboard data
- Compatible with both old (Season 8-) and new (Season 9+) API endpoints
- Fetches 2v2, 3v3, 5v5 arena brackets and RBG (Season 9+)
- Optional character details enrichment (class, race)
- Batch processing with rate limiting
- JSON output with standardized naming

## Setup

### 1. Battle.net API Credentials

1. Create a Battle.net developer account at [develop.battle.net](https://develop.battle.net)
2. Create a new client application
3. Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### 2. Configuration

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Modify the API credentials in `dumpArena.py`:

```python
# Replace with your actual credentials
wow_client = WoWPvPLeaderboard(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",        # Replace this
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET" # Replace this
)
```

### 3. Dependencies

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

Run the script:
```bash
python dumpArena.py
```

Follow the interactive prompts to:
1. Select season(s) to scrape
2. Choose brackets (2v2, 3v3, 5v5, rbg)
3. Enable/disable character details enrichment

## Output

Files are saved to `./data/` directory with format:
```
season_{season}_{bracket}_tw_arena.json
```

Example: `season_12_2v2_tw_arena.json`

## API Limitations

- Rate limited requests with automatic delays
- Character details fetching significantly increases processing time
- RBG brackets only available for Season 9+

## Notes

- Taiwan region API endpoint (`tw.api.blizzard.com`)
- Classic WoW profile namespace
- Caches character details to avoid duplicate requests
